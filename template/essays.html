          Accessibility in software looks different than it would in the outside world but it is instrumental in addressing r disabilities that may affect people's lives daily. Disabilities come in many forms, and roughly 15% of the world's population (almost 1 billion people) experience some form of need for accommodation. Accessibility in tech is relatively new but there are many ways to make things that are not only accessible to those who need specific accommodations, but beneficial to all users.

          While accessibility has steadily improved, there is still a long way to go. There are many different types of disabilities, but accessibility doesn't stop at disabilities. Sometimes it takes shape as poor network connections, or outdated hardware. While there is a large push to help users, there are also developers that require accessibility accommodations which must be addressed. Not everyone is in a position to afford the best when it comes to what tools they are able to use to make things happen. I believe that if we want to reach more people and make a difference, we need to consider everyone when making products we want to reach everyone. This means making tools available to all types of people so we can more easily gain new perspectives and notice those who may not currently have a voice in software development.

          When I make software, I make sure that things follow best practices. If I am working on design, I consider the colors I use when it comes to color blind users as well as people that might need higher contrast of colors. It is ultra important to me to at least have an option for users who may need it to make my products visible to themselves. Simplicity is key. While making the website visually pleasing, it helps everyone to find and understand what is on the screen at any time. Additionally, when writing code, it is important to follow formatting and documentation rules so that my code is easy to understand and work with others on.

          Recently, I am working on a website for Recovery Partnership. Recovery Partnership is a non-profit that provides mental health recovery services provided by those with mental health diagnosis' for others with mental health diagnosis' who could use a helping hand from someone who has been in their position before.They do amazing work helping individuals in Pennsylvania get access to helpful resources regarding basic needs such as housing, clothing, food, medical care, ect.. while also feeling understood in a world that can otherwise feel completely inaccessible to them. In my work on this website, I want to focus on accessibility as a number one priority since Recovery Partnership is composed of those who have accessibility needs and primarily helps people with those same needs. It would be a shame if some people cannot access help because they cannot utilize the website designed to reach them. It is my mission to make sure they can get the help they need from Recovery Partnership and other services like them.
