        <p class="textbody">On accessibility</p>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="essaybody">
          Accessibility in software looks different than it would in the outside world but it is instrumental in addressing disabilities that may affect people's lives daily. Disabilities come in many forms, and roughly 15% of the world's population (almost 1 billion people) experience some form of need for accommodation. Accessibility in tech is relatively new but there are many ways to make things that are not only accessible to those who need specific accommodations, but beneficial to all users.
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          While accessibility has steadily improved, there is still a long way to go. There are many different types of disabilities, but accessibility doesn't stop at disabilities. Sometimes it takes shape as poor network connections, or outdated hardware. While there is a large push to help users, there are also developers that require accessibility accommodations which must be addressed. Not everyone is in a position to afford the best when it comes to what tools they are able to use to make things happen. I believe that if we want to reach more people and make a difference, we need to consider everyone when making products we want to reach everyone. This means making tools available to all types of people so we can more easily gain new perspectives and notice those who may not currently have a voice in software development.
        </p>

          When I make software, I make sure that things follow best practices. If I am working on design, I consider the colors I use when it comes to color blind users as well as people that might need higher contrast of colors. It is ultra important to me to at least have an option for users who may need it to make my products visible to themselves. Simplicity is key. While making the website visually pleasing, it helps everyone to find and understand what is on the screen at any time. Additionally, when writing code, it is important to follow formatting and documentation rules so that my code is easy to understand and work with others on.

          Recently, I am working on a website for Recovery Partnership. Recovery Partnership is a non-profit that provides mental health recovery services provided by those with mental health diagnosis' for others with mental health diagnosis' who could use a helping hand from someone who has been in their position before.They do amazing work helping individuals in Pennsylvania get access to helpful resources regarding basic needs such as housing, clothing, food, medical care, ect.. while also feeling understood in a world that can otherwise feel completely inaccessible to them. In my work on this website, I want to focus on accessibility as a number one priority since Recovery Partnership is composed of those who have accessibility needs and primarily helps people with those same needs. It would be a shame if some people cannot access help because they cannot utilize the website designed to reach them. It is my mission to make sure they can get the help they need from Recovery Partnership and other services like them.

        <p class="textbody">On sustainability</p>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="essaybody">
          All software has a carbon footprint, and all hardware is made with limited resources that will slowly run out over time. There are different things that any developer or organization could do in order to create sustainable software such as making sure you use hardware efficiently, measuring what you do in order to see where things could be improved, and making commitments on carbon reduction. The advantages of sustainable code far outweighs any negatives as it is cheaper to run, more resilient due to better coding practices and it offers better performance. These benefits are just side effects of caring about the environment. 
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          The Internet is not free. It has a cost in energy consumption and data that is just created and then never seen. There is an estimated 2.5 billion gigabytes of data created every day. That is a lot. This number was estimated in 2020, and it most definitely has gone up since then. If it keeps going up like this, in 500 years, digital content will account for more than half of the Earth's mass. This is unsustainable and we don't need to wait until it is too late to do something about it. 
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          I believe in making sustainable software. When working on projects, I make them with a purpose in mind and then ensure that necessities are prioritized, and software comes out clean by the end. Sustainable software tends to be better anyways, so there is no downside to making it. It is more scalable because when it uses less resources to run, it is harder to hit a wall, making it cheaper to run because of optimization, and then offers better performance.

        <p class="textbody">On Agile</p>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="essaybody">
          Agile is a nice way to look at software development and takes it from this monolith of planning and meetings and then makes it an iterative and flexible process that values developers and customers. I haven't needed to work with agile until I started working in group settings and it was very enjoyable to do. I love collaboration, I love communication, and I love going. If we take a look at the manifesto itself, we can see why it is such a good way to do programming. I like all four of the lines in the manifesto, so I'll talk about them here.
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          I like “individuals and interactions over processes and tools” because it is timeless and it places the importance on the developers rather than things that may change. There are so many different programming languages and frameworks and stacks and ways to do things and there are new things being made everyday, that there will never be a developer that will know everything. This statement says that the developer doesn't need to know everything, they just need to know how to learn and work with others since the developers are going to be the people getting things done anyways. Lastly, I like this statement because it values diverse groups of individuals who know different things and can collaborate together to make something that is greater than the sum of their parts.
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          Getting things done is also important, so “working software over comprehensive documentation” is nice. I can see where people have a problem with this since documentation is very important for making code understandable for future changes and new developers to see whats going on, but there are solutions to this. Strict rules on how code is written, such as functions doing one thing, or variable names being specific can help with self documenting code. This saves a lot of time with documentation anyways and makes software work better in the future too due to improved readability and scalability.
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          I don't have much to say over “customer collaboration over contract negotiation” other than it lets developers work on features that customers are asking for rather than what's written in a preplanned contract. This is useful in the fast paced environment of the internet age where there might not be any contracts anyways if you make some service that is for the public rather than for a company. Sometimes new ideas come up mid development that are really important, and having a flexible collaborative plan over contracts help things get done faster. 
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          Going off of that, “responding to change over following a plan” gives agile its name. Plans are chunky, rigid, and never cover everything enough because sometimes we don't know exactly what is needed or wanted. Additionally, we don't always know what we can do based on who the developers are. Being adaptable is a strength that makes a great software developer due to the fact that problems that software developers face aren't always easy to solve. Sometimes problems are larger than one person, so being able to adapt as a group is a strength. In one of my trials of agile development, we planned to use Angular, but quickly switched to using React since we realized more people knew React than Angular.

      <button class="accordion">
        <p class="textbody">On Clean Code</p>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="essaybody">
          Clean code is interesting because regardless of how helpful it is, if done wrong it is incredibly detrimental. If the main focus of a programmer is to make their code as perfect as possible, nothing is getting written.
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          Working between the restrictions of clean code and the speed of agile development is a fine line to follow but it can make a programmer. We want to produce  something but need that something to be easily readable and scalable. Where can we find this fine line?
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          First, we can follow coding guidelines about how we name things like variables and functions. These guidelines can help a group of programmers be on the same page when working, and it will help any new eyes looking at older code understand it faster. Second, making sure things are decoupled as much as possible makes programs much more scalable and resistant to failure. Monoliths are out and containers are in. Last, proper documentation can help when variable and function names just don't cut it. Not everything needs a comment when we make names within our code readable and understandable without extra context. They will only be needed for things that may be confusing  upon first glance or there needs to be some extra structure involved. 
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          These practices can be done while coding without wasting too much time with planning and will make it so that refactoring, if necessary, is much easier to do. Small details such as what is the most optimal way to write a function can be avoided because sometimes the most optimal is also incredibly hard to read or the difference between time saved just isn't noticeable. Switch statements are technically faster than if statements, but sometimes it is better to use an if statement.
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          Refactoring is important, I won't say it isn't, but refactoring isn't creating anything new when it comes to a product. There are no new features involved. Sometimes that is ok, a program doesn't always need to add things to it but the easier it is to communicate the less time we can spend on it and the more time we can spend creating.

        <p class="textbody">On the Cult of Done</p>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="essaybody">
          The Cult of Done is similar to Agile in that it has a short manifesto and it is supposed to be a way of thinking that boosts productivity. The CoD manifesto does this by getting rid of roadblocks like analysis paralysis or perfectionism. Embracing imperfection, releasing your work, and creating rather than obsessing over perfection make this important for me since I used to stay still when I felt like I didn’t know enough rather than learning more. The manifesto is slightly lengthier than Agile’s, at 13 lines, but each line is important as they help get things done by framing what is done, what is in progress, and how to keep moving forward. 
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          Programming is a creative task, much like making art. There are mediums and workflows and it takes a lot of skill and practice to get good. There is an incredible amount of imposter syndrome around communities and individuals. The CoD manifesto is because it states that ignorance is part of the learning process, which may seem obvious when thinking about it, but sometimes it doesn’t come to mind.
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          I don’t want to talk about each point separately because, well, the shortness of them are a little too reckless for my taste. Some big takeaways for me are that you can get rid of procrastination by reducing the planning stage. Things shouldn’t stay as a plan for too long without being worked on because they don’t actually make you better at anything. Creative ideas don’t actually make you a more creative person either. Getting things done and doing more creative things make you a more creative person. This also works for anything, such as problem solving. Only solving more problems will make you better at solving problems, not just thinking about them. Being “done” works well with timeboxing in Agile, since you can consider something as “done” for a sprint, and then you can worry about something else and doing more. I don’t want to be stuck working on the same thing all of the time. Additionally, destroying an idea can be considered as getting something done. I tend to not drop ideas once I have them even if they don’t fit in my initial plans. While sometimes this is useful, such as thinking of an important feature for a project that wasn’t initially thought of, it can also lead to scope creep. I don’t like scope creep because it’s hard to manage properly. Throwing those creeping ideas away helps get things done. 
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          With that being said, my favorite line is “failure counts as done. So do mistakes.” I like this one a lot because sometimes failures feel really heartbreaking, but just because I failed at something doesn’t mean I didn’t progress. I may have failed a task the first time, but now I know just that much more about it for next time. 
        </p>
        <p class="essaybody">
          Being done is fun. I like being done with things. I don’t want to work on the same thing forever. I want to work on what’s next.
